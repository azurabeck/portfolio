                                In the first semester of my Computer Science graduation, I started my career as a Q.A. in a company called PSafe. 
                                But at the end of the first semester I decided to switch to Design. This did not stop me from continuing in the Q.A team
                                and only 1 year later I got a promotion untill finally reached the Senior level. After that, I decided that I would like to
                                invest in a new area of ​​knowledge, so I asked for the opportunity to move to the frontend development area, that way I could 
                                improve my skills as developer and designer. My bosses liked the idea, and shortly I started to help in the development of one 
                                of our android apps called "PowerPro". Only a few months after that, our team was transferred to the backend part of the company
                                building tools to insert data in our system, from this point I started working with frontend react and redux. This is a summary of everything 
                                I've been doing so far. I'm still writing my final paper and I'm planning to start Computer Science abroad. I enjoy studying 
                                and new challenges, so I'm looking forward to finding this new stage of my life. In the meantime, I keep studying hard and taking classes 
                                at Udacity and Udemy for improving my skills.    <br /><br />
